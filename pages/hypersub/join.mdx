## Create Account

To join a Hypersub, you must have a wallet and an email:

</div>

1. Go to any card enabled membership and click the Join button
2. Enter your card details into the form - these will be saved for future use
3. Review and Confirm

As soon as the transaction completes you'll receive a membership token, with a positive balance of time. This is what grants you access to perks and benefits promised by the creator.

When time runs out your card will be charged, refilling your token and renewing your membership. Card memberships are not eligible for [member rewards](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/rewards), but can still receive referral rewards.

### Change Card

Your card details can be updated any time:

1. Go to your [settings](https://www.hypersub.xyz/settings)
2. Click the Edit button in the Payments section
3. Enter your new card details and Save

### Cancel

Cancel your membership at any time: 

1. Go to your [settings](https://www.hypersub.xyz/settings)
2. From the Memberships section, click the ••• icon on a Hypersub's row
3. Select Cancel from the menu and click Confirm

Your membership will be cancelled immediately, refunding a prorated amount. All remaining time purchased with card is burned, causing you to lose access to member benefits.

Memberships on Hypersub accept hundreds of tokens across multiple chains. Pay with what you have without the need to swap, bridge, or hold specific tokens.

1. Go to any membership and click the Join button
2. Click the denomination button (e.g. ETH) near the Total
3. Review your available payment options
4. Select any to switch tokens and click the Join button
5. Sign the transaction, which may take a few seconds

Only one token can be used per transaction.

## Referral Rewards

Another way to benefit from a membership is through referrals. Copy the link that's displayed after you join, and share it with your friends. You'll get paid if they join the membership. How much you earn is determined by what percentage the creator has chosen.

**Example:** if the creator has a 10% referral reward, and you refer someone who purchases $100 worth of time, you'll earn $10. You don't have to be a member of a Hypersub to receive referral rewards.

## Membership Token

This token represents your membership and can be used to access a wide variety [token-gated](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-token-gating-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-doing-it) benefits from many different tools and platforms. These all depends on what is offered or supported by the creator.

**Example:** access to members-only communities such as channels or group-chats can be governed by a Hypersub's membership token. If you hold one, you can join.

Think of your token as a metro card: when you join, time is added to your balance. When time runs out, your balance can be refilled.
