Tiers offer members different benefits bundled together in increasing cost and value. They allow members more choice based on budget and preference.

To get started, go to your Dashboard and click the Tiers tab.

### When to Tier?

If you find your membership has many benefits, consider distributing them among tiers. Most memberships with tiers offer two or three.

It's ok to start off with just one set of benefits in the form of a single tier. When you know more about what your members want, you can always add more to your membership.

**Important:** members can only be on one tier at a time. If they join another tier they will be switched to that tier. Spiritually different offerings should be an entirely new membership.

### Basic Tiers

Create a new tier for your membership.

1. From the Tiers tab, click the Create tiers button
2. Enter your tier title, description, price, and rewards setting
3. Finish by clicking the Confirm button and signing the transaction, which may take a few seconds.
4. Edit your tier any time by clicking the Edit button.

**Important:** tiers can not be deleted, they can only be hidden.

## Advanced Tiers

Customize your Hypersub by using advanced tier features. Click the Advanced button while creating a new tier or when editing an existing one.

### Ideas

- Test the waters with a 3 month duration. Extend it if things are working
- Still unsure? Limit commitment to members by setting a prepaid maximum
- Create scarcity by setting a supply cap
- Get even more exclusive with an initial price
- Feeling hardcore? Permanently bond your Hypersub to members by preventing transfers

### Billing Period

Change your billing period from the monthly default. Set the billing period by switching it on and selecting a new period.

Monthly doesn't always work for some Hypersubs. Billing period alternatives include: Daily, Weekly, Quarterly and Yearly.

### Initial Price

An initial price requires members to pay a one time price before they can join your membership. Set an initial price by switching it on and entering your price.

An up front cost can guarantee more money and keep a tier exclusive. **Important:** lapsed members don't pay the initial price to add time. Members who switch tiers will have to pay again if they switch back.

### Start Time

Choose when members can join your Hypersub. Set the start time by switching it on and entering a date and time.

Start dates can better coordinate your launch. Time can not be purchased on a membership that has not started.

### End Time

Choose when your Hypersub will end. Set the end time by switching it on and entering a date and time.

End dates can be useful for events or for membership trials. Members can not purchase time beyond the end date.

### Supply Cap

Limit the number of members on your Hypersub with supply cap. Set a supply cap by switching it on and entering the number of spots.

Create exclusive tiers, limit clients or foster a tighter community. Spots in a membership are for active members only. Inactive members can be [kicked](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/dashboard#kick) by the creator to free up supply, making more spots available to others.

### Prepaid Maximum

Limit the amount of time that members can purchase. Set a max by switching it on and entering an amount of time.

This can reduce your level of commitment to members if you are unsure how long your membership will run. Setting a max will not effect members who have previously puchased time.

### Prevent Transfers

Your membership is permanently bound to members and can never be bought, sold, traded or otherwise. Prevent transfers by switching it on.

Useful for creators who want their membership kept off secondary markets. **Important:** this setting can be difficult for your members if they used an alternate account to purchase their membership.

### Hidden

Your tier is no longer visible on your membership and requires a direct link to be accessed. Enable hidden by switching it on.

Some creators may want their work kept private or reserved for a select group of members.

### Paused

Prevent active members from adding more time and prohibit any new memberships. Enable paused by switching it on.

Sometimes you need to take a break, pausing can help manage your membership by limiting transactions. **Important:** be sure to fulfill any commitments to active members after you pause. Consider refunding active members if you need to pause indefinitely.
