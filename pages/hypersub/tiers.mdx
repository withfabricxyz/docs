Tiers offer subscribers different benefits bundled together in increasing cost and value. They allow subscribers more choice based on budget and preference.

To get started, go to your dashboard and click the Tiers tab.

### Consideration

Creators generally start with one set of benefits at a single price. Once you know more about your audience, you can add more to your subscription.

When to tier? If you find your subscription has many benefits, consider dividing them into tiers. Most tiered subscriptions offer two or three tiers.

Important: subscribers can only be on one tier at a time. If they subscribe to another tier they will be switched to that tier. Spiritually different offerings should be a new subscription.

### Create

Click the Create button and enter your tier details and settings. This will look familiar to creating a subscription. Learn more about [subscription settings](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/settings).

### Deploy

Finish your tier by clicking the Create button. Important: tiers can not be deleted, once deployed your subscription will permanently have tiers. Sign the transaction with your wallet, which may take a few seconds.

### Edit

Most settings on your tier can be updated at any time. Visit your tier page and click the Edit button. Switch tiers by clicking the button with your subscription title.

### Advanced Tier

One example to consider is a lower priced tier that's open ended, and a higher priced tier that's supply-capped. Practically this could be a $5 tier that includes ABC benefits and a $15 tier that includes ABC+XYZ benefits, capped to N people.

Setting an initial price can help to filter out subscribers that are on the fence.

A 4 month duration is a good amount of time to test the waters with. You can extend it if things are working.

Still unsure? Limit your commitment to subscribers by setting max mintable time.
