# Hypersub

Hypersub is a STP-based client powering onchain subscriptions for artists, communities, software businesses, and more. Today, Hypersub is the simplest way to take full advantage of the STP protocol and setup an onchain subscription.

Every Hypersub subscription token is an NFT (ERC-721) that can be used across thousands of tools and platforms to gate access for your community, unlock perks, setup community spaces, understand your community's interests, and more.

Specifically, Hypersub NFTs are extended with the addition of a dimension of time, and economic incentives for distribution, adoption, growth, and retention.
