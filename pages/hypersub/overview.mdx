# Hypersub

Hypersub is an STP-based client enabling onchain subscriptions for artists, communities, software businesses, and more. Today, Hypersub is the simplest way to use STP.

Each Hypersub subscription token is an [ERC-721](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-glossary/what-is-erc-721) NFT. It can be used across numerous tools and platforms to unlock perks, setup community spaces, provide gated access to your community, help understand your community's interests, and more.

Hypersub NFTs have the added dimension of time, coupled with economic incentives for distribution, adoption, growth, and retention.

To learn more about STP – the protocol underlying Hypersub – see the [protocol documentation](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/stp/overview).
