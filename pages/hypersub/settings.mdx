membership settings provide more advanced ways to use your Hypersub. To access these settings you must have deployed a membership. Learn more about [creating a Hypersub](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/create).

To get started, visit your membership page and click the Edit button. These tools are powerful, and it should be noted that not all combinations are intended, or possible.

### Theme

By default, your Hypersub theme is generated based on the colors in your artwork. Set a custom theme by editing the foreground and background colors. Here's a [handy tool](https://g.co/kgs/NdxYFha) for finding hexadecimal color values.

Change the theme to better suit your membership over time. Some color combinations are better than others, always use high contrasting colors on your membership page.

### Initial Price

An initial price requires members to pay a join fee before minting time on your membership. Set an initial price by switching it on and entering your price.

This up front cost can guarantee more money while serving to filter out those on the fence. Lapsed members don't have to pay the initial price to add time. members who switch tiers will have to pay again if they switch back.

### Start Time

Choose when your Hypersub will accept members. Set the start time by switching it on and entering a date and time.

Start dates can better coordinate with other launches. Time can not be purchased on a membership that has not started.

### End Time

Choose when your Hypersub will end. Set the end time by switching it on and entering a date and time.

End dates can be useful for trialing your membership or for events. Members can not purchase time beyond an end date.

### Supply Cap

Limit the number of available spots on a membership with supply cap. This allows only a set number of members on your Hypersub. Set a supply cap by switching it on and entering the number of spots.

Used by freelance creators to limit the amount clients they take on, or by memberships, limiting numbers to foster a tighter community.

Spots in a membership are for active members only. Inactive members can be [kicked](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/dashboard#kick) by the creator to free up supply, making more spots available to others.

### Max Mintable Time

Limit the amount of time that members can purchase. Set a max by switching it on and entering an amount of time.

This can reduce your level of commitment to members if you are unsure how long your membership will run. Setting a max will not effect members who have previously puchased time.

### Non-Transferable Token

Your membership token is permanently bound to members and can never be bought, sold, traded or otherwise. Enable non-transferrable tokens by switching it on.

Useful for creators who may want access to their membership kept off of secondary markets. This setting has a strong effect and can be difficult for your members if they use an alternate account to purchase their membership.

### Hidden

Your membership is no longer discoverable on Hypersub and requires a direct link to be accessed. For memberships with multiple tiers, it is no longer visible in your tier switcher or on your collection page. Enable hidden by switching it on.

Some creators may want their work kept private or reserved for a select group of members.

### Paused

Prevent active members from adding more time and prohibit any new memberships. Enable paused by switching it on.

Sometimes you need to take a break, pausing can help manage your membership by limiting transactions. Be sure to fulfill any commitments to active members after you pause. Consider refunding active members if you need to pause indefinitely.
