# Subscription Settings

Subscription settings provide more advanced ways to use your Hypersub. To access these settings you must have deployed a Hypersub.

To get started, visit your subscription page and use the edit button above the title. These tools are powerful, and it should be noted that not all combinations are intended, or possible.

You can find information about artwork, title, description and price covered in [Create a Hypersub](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/create).

### Theme

As a default your Hypersub is themed based on dominant colors from the artwork. Set a custom theme by editing the foreground and background color codes.

Change the theme to better suit your subscription over time. Some color combinations are better than others, always use high contrasting colors on your subscription page.

### Initial Price

An initial price requires subscribers to pay a join fee before minting time on your subscription. Set an initial price by switching it on and entering your price.

This up front cost can guarantee more money while serving to filter out those on the fence. Lapsed subscribers don't have to pay the initial price to add time. Subscribers who switch tiers will have to pay again if they switch back.

### Subscription duration

Configure a start date, end date, or both for your Hypersub with subscription duration. Set the duration by switching it on and entering a date and time.

Start dates can better coordinate with other launches, while end dates can be useful for events. Use both to maintain a definite timeline for your subscription. Time can not be purchased on a subscription that has not started. Subscribers can not purchase time beyond an end date.

### Supply Cap

Limit the number of available spots on a subscription with supply cap. This allows only a set number of subscribers for your Hypersub. Set a supply cap by switching it on and entering the number of spots.

Used by freelance creators to limit the amount clients they take on, or by memberships, keeping numbers low to foster a tighter community.

Spots in a subscription are for active subscribers. Inactive subscribers can be kicked by the creator to free up supply, making more spots available to others.

### Max Mintable Time

Limit the amount of time that subscribers can purchase. Set a max by switching it on and entering an amount of time.

This can reduce your level of commitment to subscribers if you are unsure how long your subscription will run. Setting a max will not effect subscribers who have previously puchased time.

### Non-Transferable Token

Your subscription token is permanently bound to the subscriber and can never be bought, sold, traded or otherwise. Enable non-transferrable tokens by switching it on.

Useful for creators who may want access to their subscription kept off of secondary markets. This setting has a strong effect and can be difficult for your subscribers if they use an unintended or alternate address.

### Pause

Prevent active subscribers from adding more time and prohibit new subscriptions. Enable pause by switching it on.

Sometimes you need to take a break, pausing can help manage your subscription by limiting transactions. Be sure to fulfill any commitments to active subscriberes after you pause. Consider refunding active subscribers if you need to pause indefinitely.
