# Subscription Settings

This section details the more specific ways to use your Hypersub. To access these settings you must have deployed a Hypersub. These are powerful tools, and it should be noted that not all combinations are intended, or possible.

You can find information about artwork, title, description and price covered in [Create a Hypersub](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/create).

### Initial Price

An initial price requires subscribers to pay a join fee in order to mint time on your subscription. This up front cost can guarantee more money while serving to filter out those on the fence. Lapsed subscribers don't have to pay the initial price to mint more time. Subscribers who switch tiers will have to pay if they switch back.

### Duration

Set a start date, end date, or both with subscription duration. Setting a start date can better coordinate with other launches, while end dates can be useful for events. Time can not be purchased on a subscription that has not started. Subscribers can not purchase time beyond an end date.

### Supply Cap

Limit the number of available spots on a subscription with supply cap. This allows only a set number of subscribers for your Hypersub. Used by freelance creators to limit the amount clients they take on, or by memberships, keeping numbers low to foster a tighter community.

Spots in a subscription are for active subscribers. Inactive subscribers can be kicked by the creator to free up supply, making more spots available to others.

### Max Mintable Time

Set a maximum amount of time that can be purchased by subscribers. This can limit your level of commitment to subscribers if you are unsure how long your subscription will run.

### Non-Transferable Token

Your subscription token is permanently bound to the subscriber and can never be bought, sold, traded or otherwise. Useful for creators who may want access to their subscription kept off of secondary markets.

### Pause

Subscriptions can be paused. This will prevent any new subscribers from joining and current subscribers from purchasing more time.
