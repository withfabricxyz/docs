Gift time on your Hypersub to new or existing members with Grants. To get started, go to your Dashboard and click the Grants tab.

### Create Grant

1. Click the Create button and enter one or more accounts
2. Select an amount of time. 
3. Review, confirm and sign the transaction.

Creators new to Hypersub can use grants to import their audience from other platforms or memberships. To import paste in your audience account list, select a time, and confirm.

### New Members

Create new members by granting people time to your membership. Grantees are members, and enjoy most benefits such as Drops and Access.

Granted memberships do not receive [Rewards](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/rewards) for that time. No money in, no money out.

### Existing Members

Extend time to existing memberships. Granted time is added on top of a member's current balance.

### Migrate Members

When granting time to tier members you have the option to migrate them to another tier.

1. Click the Create button and select the tier you want to migrate members to
2. Click Review, then switch on Migrate
3. Confirm and sign the transaction.

**Important:** all of a member's previously remaining time is burned during migration. Be sure to grant an equitable amount of time to their previous balance. For example, if a member had 3 months left on Tier A, grant them at least 3 months when migrating them to Tier B.
