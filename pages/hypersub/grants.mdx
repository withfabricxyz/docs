# Grants

Gift time on your Hypersub to new or existing subscribers with grants.

To get started, go to your dashboard and select the grants tab.

### Create

Create a grant by using the button at the top left of the page. Enter one or more addresses and select an amount of time. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction.

Creators new to Hypersub can use grants to import their audience from other platforms or subscriptions. When creating a grant paste in the addresses of your audience, select a time, and confirm. Grants are limited to 200 addresses at one time.

### New Subscribers

Instantly gift time to individuals who are new to your subscription. Grantees are subscribers and have all of the same benefits as others such as drops, perks, and access.

### Existing Subscribers

Extend time on your Hypersub to existing subscribers. Granted time is added on top of a subscriber's current balance.
