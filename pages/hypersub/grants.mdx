Gift time on your Hypersub to new or existing members with Grants.

To get started, go to your dashboard and click the Grants tab.

### Create

Click the Create button, enter one or more accounts and select an amount of time. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction.

Creators new to Hypersub can use grants to import their audience from other platforms or memberships. When creating a grant paste in the accounts of your audience, select a time, and confirm. Grants are limited to 200 accounts at one time.

### New Members

Instantly gift time to individuals who are new to your membership. Grantees are members, and enjoy most benefits such as Drops and Access. Members who are granted time do not receive [Rewards](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/rewards).

### Existing Members

Extend time on your Hypersub to existing members. Granted time is added on top of a member's current balance.

### Migrate Members

When granting time to members on tiers you have the option to migrate them to another tier. Create a grant and select a tier. Click review, then switch on Migrate. Confirm and sign the transaction.

Important: all of a member's previously remaining time on another tier is burned during migration. Be sure to grant equitable amounts of time to their remaining balance. For example, if a member had 3 months left before migration, grant them at least 3 months of time.
