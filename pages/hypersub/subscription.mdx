Subscribe to what you believe in and enjoy the benefits of supporting creators onchain. View pricing details, perks and other offerings from creators on their subscription pages.

### Subscribe

To subscribe on Hypersub, make sure your wallet is connected. Visit any subscription page and click the Subscribe button to mint time onchain.

You'll be asked for an email, which is needed for subscription notifications and is required to subscribe. Verify by entering the six-digit code sent to your email.

### Minting

Minting is the act of purchasing time on a subscription. Select how much time you want to purchase, then click the Subscribe button. You'll be prompted to sign the transaction with your wallet, which may take a few seconds.

As soon as the transaction completes you'll receive a subscription token, with a positive balance of time. This is what grants you access to the perks and benefits promised by the creator.

### Subscription Token

This token represents your subscription and can be used to access a wide variety [token-gated](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-token-gating-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-doing-it) benefits across an ecosystem of tools and platforms. This all depends on what is offered or supported by the creator. A common example is access to subscriber only communities such as channels or group-chats.

You can think of your token as a metro card: when you subscribe, you add time to your balance. When time runs out, your balance can be refilled.

### Adding Time

You'll be notified when your subscription time is running low. To add more time, visit the subscription page and click the Add Time button.

If time runs out, you still own your subscription token, though you will become inactive. Inactive subscribers no longer gain subscription benefits like drops, perks, or access. Become active again by adding more time.

### Referrals

Another way to benefit from a subscription is through referrals. Copy the link that's displayed after you subscribe, and share it with your friends. You'll get paid when they subscribe. How much you earn is determined by what percentage the creator has chosen to share.

For example, if the creator chose a 10% referral reward, and you refer someone who mints $100 worth of time, you'll earn $10. You don't have to be subscribed to a Hypersub to receive referral rewards.

### Alternative Payments

Subscriptions on Hypersub now accept hundreds of tokens across multiple chains. Pay with what you have without the need to swap, bridge, or hold specific tokens.

Visit any subscription page and click the Subscribe button. Click the token symbol button (e.g. ETH) near the Total to open the menu. This menu is populated based on what is in your wallet. Swap payment methods by selecting another token and subscribe.

## Drops

Drops are versatile and can take on all forms of media such as art NFTs, podcast episodes, music releases, articles, updates and more. These also coincide with non-media such as events, access or otherwise. The drops tab is usually where new subscription value is accessed and visualized, and also doubles as a history of value delivered over time.
