</div>

1. From your dashboard, click the Drops tab, then click Create
2. Enter the url of your mint page, populating the rest of the form with [Open Graph](https://www.opengraph.xyz) metadata. You can upload a new image or edit the text. **Important:** this information appears publicly on the Drops tab of your Membership Profile and on your member's profile pages.
3. Click Create to notify your members

**Important:** make sure you use your Hypersub account when logging in to other sites to create a drop. For example, if you use alice.eth for your Hypersub, use alice.eth when creating a drop.

Airdrop on Hypersub is only supported for [PODS](https://pods.media/), [Sound.xyz](https://www.sound.xyz/), and [Zora](https://zora.co/).
