# Drops

Drops are the primary method for creators on Hypersub to deliver value to their subscribers. Learn how to create a drop along with a few tips for getting the most out of it.

### Get Started

Drops can deliver NFTs directly to your subscribers. To get started you will need to create an external mint page. This is where the NFTs you drop originate from.

There are a variety of sites to choose from; [Zora](https://zora.co/), [Pods](https://pods.media/), [Sound](https://www.sound.xyz/), [Manifold](https://www.manifold.xyz/), or [Highlight](https://highlight.xyz/) are most commonly used by creators. Explore your options and select one that best suits your subscription.

Choose a site and create a mint page. Important: make sure you use your Hypersub address when creating your mint page. For example if you use alice.eth for your Hypersub, use alice.eth for your mint page.

Once complete, visit your new mint page and copy the url. Return to Hypersub to create your drop.

### Create

From your subscription page select the drops tab at the top of the page. Next use the create button at the top left of the page. Enter the url of your mint page, which populates the rest of the form.

Edit the image, title or description if needed. This information appears publicly on your subscriber's profiles. Use the create button to finish and notify subscribers of your new drop.

### Airdrop

Automatically send NFTs directly to each of your subscribers. When a drop is completed you are prompted to airdrop the NFTs from your mint page.

Review and confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction. Airdrops require no action from subscribers to receive their NFTs.

### Alternative Uses

Drops are versatile and are not exclusive to NFTs. Here are some examples of how you can use drops without a mint page:

- Make an update to your subscribers
- Link to token-gated communities
- Present freelance work
- Announce members only events
- Promote new application features
