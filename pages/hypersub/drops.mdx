# Drops

Drops are the primary means by which creators on Hypersub deliver value to their members. Learn how to create a drop along with a few tips for getting the most out of this feature.

To get started, you'll need to create an external mint page.

## Mint Page

Drops deliver NFTs directly to your members from a mint page. This page is where the NFTs originate from.

There are a variety of sites to choose from; [Highlight](https://highlight.xyz/), [Manifold](https://www.manifold.xyz/), [Pods](https://pods.media/), [Sound](https://www.sound.xyz/), or [Zora](https://zora.co/) are most commonly used by creators. Explore your options and select one that best suits your membership.

Choose a site and create a mint page for your NFT. Important: make sure you use your Hypersub account when creating your NFT. For example, if you use alice.eth for your Hypersub, use alice.eth to create your NFT.

Once complete, visit your new mint page and copy the url. Return to Hypersub to create your drop.

## Create Drop

</div>

From your membership page, click the Drops tab, then click Create. Enter the URL of your mint page, which populates the rest of the form with the [Open Graph](https://www.opengraph.xyz) metadata. You can upload a new image or edit the text.

This information appears publicly on the Drops page of your Hypersub and on your member's profile pages. Click the Create button to complete the drop and notify members.

## Airdrop via Hypersub

Send your work directly to each of your members from Hypersub. When a drop is created you'll be prompted to airdrop from your linked mint page.

Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction. Airdrops require no action from members to be received.

Airdrop via Hypersub is only supported for [Pods](https://pods.media/), [Sound](https://www.sound.xyz/), and [Zora](https://zora.co/).

## Airdrop via Manifold

Airdrop exclusively to your members without your work going up for sale.

### Create a Claim Page

To get started go to [manifold.xyz](https://www.manifold.xyz/) and log in.

1. Click the Create button and select Claim page
2. Click New Contract and enter details matching your Hypersub or tier, and click Next
3. Upload your media, enter the details, click Save then Next
4. Enter the details of your mint page, click Next
5. Enter your mint rules. Important: set the Total Supply to Limited: 1. Click Next
6. Do not edit your Audience settings, click Next
7. Review, click Publish and confirm the transaction - this may take a few seconds
8. ðŸŽ‰

Setting the supply limit to 1 does not effect how many members can receive your airdrop. It limits exposure to your mint page being discovered in the window before you airdrop. Once airdropped, your work will be sold out and not mintable by the public.

### Create a CSV

Create a members only account list for your airdrop.

1. Go to your Hypersub dashboard and click Export
2. Scroll to the account area and click the copy icon
3. Open TextEdit or similar application, create a new file, and paste your member accounts
4. Append each account with ,1 and save

Important: be sure to end your file name with .csv before you save.

### Airdrop to Members

Deliver your work directly to members.

1. Go to your Creations in Manifold and click the work you want to airdrop
2. Click the More Options tab and upload your CSV
3. Click Begin Airdrop and confirm the transaction

### Drop on Hypersub

Notify members about your airdrop, and present your work to the world.

1. Go to the Claim page on Manifold you airdropped from and copy the url
2. Go to your membership page on Hypersub and click the Drops tab
3. Click Create drop and paste in your Claim page url
4. Click Create to save and notify your members

Important: the airdrop has already occurred from Manifold, dropping on Hypersub does not airdrop again.

## Airdrop via Highlight

Setting the mint duration to a one minute does not effect whether or not members can receive your airdrop. It limits exposure to someone finding your mint page in the small window of time after the contract is deployed. Once airdropped, your mint will have ended and is unavailable to the public.

Important: for steps 3 and 4 be sure to use the same account as the one used when creating your mint page.
