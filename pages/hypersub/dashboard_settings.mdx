Manage important subscription details at the contract level. Access your contract, owner and revenue recipent addresses.

To get started, go to your dashboard and click the Settings tab.

### Contract Address

Your contract address is the unique identifier for your subscription. You will need this address when setting up various token-gated features for use by your subscribers.  

### Owner

The Owner address has sole administrative access to your subscription. By default this is the address that created the subscription. Ownership can be changed by transferring it to another address.

Warning: changing ownership has a strong effect, once the new owner accepts you will lose access to your subscription. This action can not be undone.

Change ownership by Clicking the Transfer button. Enter the address of the new owner. Important: make sure the new address is correct as it will become the new owner and have full administrative access of your subscription. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction.

The ownership transfer is now pending. The new owner must accept to complete the transfer. Copy the transfer link and share it with the new owner.

### Revenue Recipient

The revenue recipient is the address where your subscription funds are sent. By default this is the same address as the owner, but they can be different.

Change your revenue recipient by clicking the Edit button. Enter the address of the new revenue recipient. Important: make sure the new address is correct as it is where withdrawn funds will be sent. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction.

Reasons for different revenue recipients may vary, but can include more advanced options such as a [splits](https://splits.org/) contract or a [multisig](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/wallet/what-is-a-multi-signature-multi-sig-wallet) address.
