Enable card payments and Hypermod, while managing other important membership details.

To get started, go to your Dashboard and click the Settings tab.

### Card Payments

Automate your membership via recurring payments. Card payments on Hypersub use Stripe Connect, which requires identity verification. Learn more about [Card Payments](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/cards).

### Hypermod

Use Hypersub to automatically add and remove members from your Farcaster channel. Learn more about [Hypermod](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/tips#hypermod).

### Contract Address

Your contract address is the unique identifier for your membership. Use this address when setting up various token-gated features for use by your members. Learn more about [Access](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/access).

### Owner

The Owner account has sole administrative access to your membership. By default this is the account that created your membership. Ownership can be changed by transferring it to another account.

**Warning:** once the new Owner accepts the transfer you will permanently lose access to your membership. This action can not be undone.

1. From the Ownership section click the Transfer ownership button
2. Enter the address of the new Owner. **Important:** make sure the new account is correct as it will become the new Owner and have full administrative access to your membership
3. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction
4. Copy the link and share it with the new Owner

The ownership transfer is now pending, the new owner must accept it to complete the transfer.

### Revenue Recipient

The revenue recipient is the account where your membership earning are sent. By default this is the same address as the owner, but they can be different.

Change your revenue recipient by clicking the Edit button. Enter the address of the new revenue recipient. Important: make sure the new address is correct as it is where withdrawn funds will be sent. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction.

Reasons for different revenue recipients may vary, but can include more advanced options such as a [splits](https://splits.org/) contract or a [multisig](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/wallet/what-is-a-multi-signature-multi-sig-wallet) address.
