# Pricing

Finding the right subscription pricing involves balancing cost, value, and satisfaction. The goal is to ensure subscribers feel they're getting enough value for the price they pay.

Usually creators start out with just one set of benefits at a single price. Once a greater understanding of your audience is achieved, you can always add more to your subscription.

### Metrics

Pricing can vary depending on a few things:

- Audience: What is the size and engagement level?
- Demand: How do trends, interests and relevance effect you?
- Quality: How much effort are you putting in?
- Complexity: How intricate are your offerings?
- Frequency: How often are you delivering value?

Each one of these metics and more can influence pricing. Stopping to take an inventory of where you are at as a creator can help to clarify.

### Ranges

Generally pricing can outline three ranges; low, medium and high:

- Low: $1-5
- Medium: $5-15
- High: $15-50+

Generally a low prices attract more subscribers, while a high prices attract less. Consider your offerings and where they fit within these baselines.

### Tiers

Tiers can offer subscribers a menu of options that increase in cost and value. It allows for more choice based on budget and preference. Imagine you're attending a music festival with different passes; Basic, VIP and All Access.

For tiered pricing we can take our range baselines and map them to tiers:

- Basic: $1-5
- Mid: $5-15
- Top: $15-50+

Simple is better, limit your number of tiers to avoid overwhelming subscribers. You should have a very good reason for creating a new tier.

### Free Subscriptions

Free or, more correctly, pay what you want is an option. This can be useful as a low commitment way for subscribers to get a taste of your offerings and see if they want to fully take the plunge.

A good example of a free subscription is a newsletter. While paying subscribers receive this in addition to other benefits, it allows free susbcribers to get some value and keeps them in the loop.

Free susbcriptions can work well in both 2 or 3 tier pricing models.

### Note on Description

Descriptions can be key to getting subscribers. People want to know what your subscription is about, and little to no or cryptic details will leave subscribers unsure about your offerings.

- Present value quickly and clearly. Subscribers want to know exactly what they get without effort.
- Use bullet points for easy scanning. Large blocks of text will probably not be read.
- Add links. Subscribers want to see you're alive elsewhere and to know more about you.
- Provide social proof. Show how your current subscribers are benefiting.
