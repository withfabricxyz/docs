# Pricing

Finding the right membership pricing involves balancing cost and benefit. The goal is to ensure members feel they're getting enough value for the price they pay.

### Consideration

Pricing can vary depending on a few things:

- Audience: What is the size and engagement level?
- Demand: What is the demand for the creative work you're doing?
- Frequency: How often are you delivering value?

### Ranges

Some common pricing ranges are:

- Low: $1-5
- Medium: $5-15
- High: $15-50+

As a baseline: memberships with lower price points tend to have more members, and earn more money in absolute terms, whereas memberships with higher price points tend to have fewer members, and earn less on average.

There is no right answer with regard to pricing or member volume, go with what feels right for you âœ¨ You can always change it later.

### Tiers

For tiered pricing we can take our range baselines and map them to tiers:

- Basic: $1-5
- Mid: $5-15
- Top: $15-50+

Simple is better, limit the number of tiers to avoid overwhelming member. A good reason for tiers is when you have a wide range of offerings to bundle together. Learn more about [tiers](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/tiers).

### Free Memberships

Free memberships are a low commitment way for members to get a taste of your offerings and see if they want to fully take the plunge.

A free membership could include just one benefit. While paying members receive this in addition to other benefits, it allows free members to get some value and keeps them in the loop.

Free memberships can work well in both 2 or 3 tier pricing models.
