# Pricing

Finding the right subscription pricing involves balancing cost and benefit. The goal is to ensure subscribers feel they're getting enough value for the price they pay.

### Considerations

Pricing can vary depending on a few things:

- Audience: What is the size and engagement level?
- Demand: What is the demand for the creative work you're doing?
- Frequency: How often are you delivering value?

### Ranges

Some common pricing ranges are:

- Low: $1-5
- Medium: $5-15
- High: $15-50+

A general rule-of-thumb is: subscriptions with lower price points tend to have more subscribers, and earn more money in absolute terms, whereas subscriptions with higher price points tend to have fewer subscribers, and earn less on average.

There is no right answer with regard to pricing or subscriber volume, go with what feels right for youâœ¨ You can always change it later.

### Tiers

For tiered pricing we can take our range baselines and map them to tiers:

- Basic: $1-5
- Mid: $5-15
- Top: $15-50+

Simple is better, limit the number of tiers to avoid overwhelming subscribers. A good reason for tiers is when you have a wide range of offerings to bundle together.

### Free Subscriptions

Free subscriptions are a low commitment way for subscribers to get a taste of your offerings and see if they want to fully take the plunge.

A free subscription could include just one benefit. While paying subscribers receive this in addition to other benefits, it allows free susbcribers to get some value and keeps them in the loop.

Free susbcriptions can work well in both 2 or 3 tier pricing models.

### Your Description

Descriptions can be key to getting subscribers - people want to know what your subscription is about. Little or cryptic details will leave subscribers unsure about your offerings.

- Present value quickly and clearly. Subscribers want to know exactly what they get without effort.
- Use bullet points for easy scanning. Large blocks of text will probably not be read.
- Add links. Subscribers want to see you're alive elsewhere and know more about you.
- Provide social proof. Show how your current subscribers are benefiting.
