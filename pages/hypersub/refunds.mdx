Creators can issue refunds to one or more members. A refund removes all remaining time from a membership balance, with the value of that remaining time refunded to the member. Any granted time is removed, but not refunded.

To get started, go to your Dashboard and click the Refunds tab. Refunds on Hypersub are for crypto payments only, learn more about [card refunds](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/cards#refunds).

### Create Refund

1. Click the Create Refund button and enter one or more accounts
2. Review, confirm and sign the transaction

Members are refunded from your Hypersub's balance. If the balance is insufficient you'll need to cover the remaining cost of the refund.

Bulk refunds are a graceful way for creators to wind down a membership.

### Custom Refund

Issue refunds for a specific amount with the Custom option.

1. Click the Create Refund button and enter one or more accounts
2. Select Custom and enter an amount
3. Review, confirm and sign the transaction

Custom refunds can be issued to single or multiple accounts. Multiple accounts each receive the same amount.

### Membership Token

When a member is refunded they still hold their membership token, even though all remaining time is removed. Without time they lose members-only access, benefits, and drops.

Refunded members are not [kicked](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/dashboard#kick) from your Hypersub. They still hold on to their spot in a supply cap and may also purchase time in the future.
