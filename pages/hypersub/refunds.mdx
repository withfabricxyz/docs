Creators can issue refunds to one or more subscribers. Refunding a subscriber removes all time from their subscription balance. The value of that remaining time is refunded to them. Any granted time is removed, but not refunded.

To get started, go to your dashboard and click the Refunds tab.

### Create

Click the create button, select single or bulk and enter one or more addresses. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction.

Subscribers are refunded from your Hypersub's balance. If the balance is insufficient you'll need to cover the remaining cost of the refund. Any excess funds from the transaction are deposited back into your subscription balance.

For now bulk refunds are a graceful way for creators to wind down a subscription.

### Custom

Issue refunds for specific amounts with the custom option. Create a refund and select Custom. Enter the amount you would like refunded to the subscriber. Confirm and sign.

Custom refunds can only be issued to single addresses.

### Subsciption Token

When a subscriber is refunded they still hold their subscription token, though all remaining time is removed. Without time they lose access to subscription benefits, drops and perks.

Refunded subscribers are not [kicked](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/dashboard#kick) from your Hypersub. They still hold on to their spot in a supply cap and may also purchase time in the future.
