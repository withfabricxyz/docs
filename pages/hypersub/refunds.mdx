Creators can issue refunds to one or more members. Refunding a member removes all time from their membership balance. The value of that remaining time is refunded to them. Any granted time is removed, but not refunded.

To get started, go to your dashboard and click the Refunds tab.

### Create

Click the Create button, select single or bulk and enter one or more accounts. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction.

Members are refunded from your Hypersub's balance. If the balance is insufficient you'll need to cover the remaining cost of the refund. Any excess funds from the transaction are deposited back into your membership balance.

Bulk refunds are a graceful way for creators to wind down a membership.

### Custom

Issue refunds for specific amounts with the custom option. Create a refund and select Custom. Enter the amount you would like refunded to the member. Confirm and sign.

Custom refunds can only be issued to single accounts.

### Membership Token

When a member is refunded they still hold their membership token, though all remaining time is removed. Without time they lose access to membership access, benefits, and drops.

Refunded members are not [kicked](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/dashboard#kick) from your Hypersub. They still hold on to their spot in a supply cap and may also purchase time in the future.
