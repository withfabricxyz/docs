Deploying a Hypersub contract requires artwork, a collection name, a description, pricing, and rewards settings.

## NFT Artwork

A Hypersub's NFT artwork is the artwork that is displayed in your subscribers' wallets, on social platforms, and in marketplaces where tokens are bought and sold.

## Collection Name & Description

Your collection name is the name of your Hypersub, and also acts as the name that is displayed in your collectors' wallets. Your description is the additional information that is displayed on your Hypersub page and is a place to describe who you are, what your Hypersub is about, and what benefits subscribers can expect to receive by subscribing.

Descriptions are styled with Markdown. If you have never used Markdown or are looking for a quick cheat sheet, we recommend this [documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Descriptions can support any Markdown syntax, including images, links, code samples, and more.

## Pricing

Pricing has two components: price and period.

Price can be denominated in any ERC20 on Base, with the defaults being ETH, USDC, or DAI. Cost represents how much is being paid per unit of time. Period is the unit of time being priced, with the options being weeks, months, and years.

Most Hypersubs are priced monthly (e.g. 20 USDC per month), but many take full advantage of the customizations that Hypersub offers (e.g. 10 $DEGEN per week).

For advice on how to think about pricing your Hypersub, see our Pricing best practices.

## FAQs

### How should I price my Hypersub?

Pricing is more an art than a science, and is unique to your offering and audience. You can learn more about some of our best practices here.

### Can I use a video/GIF for the NFT image?

Yes, we support 1:1 (square), 3:2 (landscape), and 2:3 (portrait) aspect ratios. Minimum 800px wide.

### Can I change X later?

Yes, all components of a contract can be changed after deployment (although you may have to pay additional gas).
