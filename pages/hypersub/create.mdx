# Create a Hypersub

As creator on Hypersub your first step is creating a subscription. This requires artwork, a collection name, description, pricing, and a rewards setting. Any decisions made now can be changed later.

To get started, make sure your wallet is connected and use the create button at the top right of the page. This takes you to the [create page](https://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/create).

### Artwork

Your Hypersub artwork is the imagery displayed on your subscription page, in subscribers' wallets, on social platforms, and in marketplaces where tokens are bought and sold. This image should richly define your subscription at a glance and will often be the first thing seen of your Hypersub.

Upload your image by using the Upload button. While Hypersub supports most images, we recommend formatting your images to 1:1 (square), 3:2 (landscape), and 2:3 (portrait) with a minimum of 800px wide. Your Hypersub artwork will display best within these guidelines.

### Title & Description

Your collection name is the title of your Hypersub, and, similar to artwork, will be reflected in your subscribers' wallets and elsewhere. Your description is additional information displayed on your Hypersub detailing who you are, what your Hypersub is about, and what benefits subscribers can expect.

Descriptions can be styled in the text editor. Use the buttons in the editor to format text to your liking. You can add important links here as well as images, gifs and video.

### Pricing

Your subscription can be priced in any ERC20 token on [Base](https://www.base.org/), with the defaults being ETH, USDC, or DAI. This price is how much subscribers pay per week, month or year. Most Hypersubs are priced per month. Notably you will always withdraw ETH from your subscription, no matter what subscribers pay in.

### Custom Tokens

To price your Hypersub in custom tokens use the Custom option in the menu. Here you will need to provide a contract address for the desired token. Visit [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/) and search for the token. On the token page (e.g. [DEGEN](https://basescan.org/token/0x4ed4e862860bed51a9570b96d89af5e1b0efefed)) copy the contract address from the Other Info section. Return to Hypersub and paste in the address, selecting the token as your denomination.

### Rewards

Rewards gives you the ability to share revenue with your subscribers. For creating a subscription we'll start simple, though subscriber rewards can have more advanced options.

To enable rewards enter a percentage of revenue to share with the rewards pool. To opt out of rewards set the percentage to zero. Learn more about [subscriber rewards](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/rewards).

### Preview

Use the preview button to save your draft and and preview your Hypersub. Get back to your draft any time by visiting your [dashboard > all](https://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/dashboard?from=spark).

Preview will also reveal your Hypersub's theme. Your theme is based on image color, which can be changed later if needed.

### Deploy

Finish creating your Hypersub by using the deploy button. Sign with your wallet to start the transaction, which may take a few seconds. Once deployed your Hypersub is ready to accept subscribers.

### Editing

Most settings on your Hypersub can be changed any time. Visit your subscription page and use the Edit button above the title. Manage all of your subscription settings here.

You may notice other advanced settings here, these are detailed in [subscription settings](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/settings).
