# Create a Hypersub

As creator on Hypersub your first step is to create a subscription. Make sure your wallet is connected and use the Create button in the top right to get started. This will take you to the [create page](https://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/create). From here you will want to invest some time creating your subscription.

Creating a Hypersub requires artwork, a collection name, a description, pricing, and a rewards setting. Worry not, any decisions made now can be changed later.

### Artwork

Your Hypersub artwork is the imagery displayed on your subscription page, in subscribers' wallets, on social platforms, and in marketplaces where tokens are bought and sold. This image should richly define your subscription at a glance and will often be the first thing seen of your Hypersub.

Upload your image by using the Upload button. While Hypersub supports most images, we recommend formatting your images to 1:1 (square), 3:2 (landscape), and 2:3 (portrait) with a minimum of 800px wide. Your Hypersub artwork will display best within these guidelines.

### Title & Description

Your collection name is the title of your Hypersub, and, similar to artwork, will be reflected in your subscribers' wallets and elsewhere. Your description is additional information displayed on your Hypersub detailing who you are, what your Hypersub is about, and what benefits subscribers can expect.

Descriptions can be styled in the text editor. Use the buttons in the editor to format text to your liking. You can add important links here as well as images, gifs and video.

### Pricing

Your subscription can be priced in any ERC20 token on [Base](https://www.base.org/), with the defaults being ETH, USDC, or DAI. This price is how much subscribers pay per week, month or year. Most Hypersubs are priced per month. Notably you will always withdraw ETH from your subscription, no matter what subscribers pay in.

### Custom Tokens

To price your Hypersub in custom tokens use the Custom option in the menu. Here you will need to provide a contract address for the desired token. Visit [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/) and search for the token. On the token page (e.g. [DEGEN](https://basescan.org/token/0x4ed4e862860bed51a9570b96d89af5e1b0efefed)) copy the contract address from the Other Info section. Return to Hypersub and paste in the address, selecting the token as your denomination.

### Rewards

Rewards gives you the ability to share revenue with your subscribers. For creating a subscription we'll start simple, though details of advanced rewards offerings can be intricate. To offer rewards share a percentage of revenue with the rewards pool. To opt out of rewards set the percentage to zero. Learn more about [Subscriber Rewards](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/rewards).

### Preview

With your subscription filled out the next step is to preview. Upon preview your Hypersub is now saved as a draft. Get back to your draft any time by visiting your Dashboard. Your theme is based on image color, which can be changed later if needed. If everything looks good the final step is to deploy your Hypersub.

### Deploy

Finish creating your Hypersub by using the deploy button. Sign with your wallet to start the transaction, which may take a few seconds. Congratulations, your Hypersub is now deployed and ready to accept subscribers.

### Editing

Once deployed, initial settings on your Hypersub can be changed any time. Visit your subscription page and use the Edit button above the title. From here you will be able to update your subscription settings. You may notice other advanced settings here, these are detailed in [Subscription Settings](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/settings).
