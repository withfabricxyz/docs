As creator on Hypersub, your first step is creating a membership. This requires a name, artwork, description, pricing, and a rewards setting. Most decisions made now can be changed later.

To get started, make sure your wallet is connected and click the Create button. This takes you to the [create page](https://hypersub.xyz/create/new).

## Create

From the create page, enter the title of your membership and claim your personalized page link.

**Important:** your page link is what displays in the browser search bar and wherever you paste a link to your membership. Once set, it can not be changed.

## Membership Profile

Your membership profile is where anyone can get to know who you are, what your Hypersub is about, and join your membership.

### Wallpaper

Your Hypersub wallpaper is the imagery displayed at the top of your membership profile. It covers a large surface area and should provide plenty of context about your Hypersub. Your wallpaper is powerful, and can set the tone of your membership.

Your wallpaper should be a large, high resolution image in a 3:1 aspect ratio, at a minimum width of 1500px. Take the opportunity to consider what is likely to be the first thing people will see when visiting your membership profile.

### Profile Description

Your description should provide a quick overview of your Hypersub - bio, background info, goals, accolades, history, social or portfolio links etc. 

Keep your description breif and direct, content greater than three lines is truncated.

## Tiers

Tiers offer members different benefits bundled together at increasing cost and value. They allow members more choice based on budget and preference. One tier is required to create your Hypersub.

### Art

Hypersub supports .png, .jpg, and .gif. Your image should be in a 1:1 (square), 3:2 (landscape), or 2:3 (portrait) aspect ratio, at a minimum of 800px wide.  Learn more about [Images](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/tips#images).

### Tier Description

Your tier description should be a clear list of benefits members can expect. **Example:** some benefits include:

- Weekly, bi-monthly or monthly airdrops
- Exclusive or members-only editions
- 1/1 art or token raffles
- Channel access
- Group chats

### Pricing

Crypto prices are in USDC, ETH, or most other ERC20 tokens on [Base](https://www.base.org/). This is how much members pay per month. Hypersub also supports [Card Payments](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/cards).

**Important:** you are paid in the denomination you choose for your membership, no matter which token members pay with. Denomination is the same across all tiers, and can not be changed once a membership has been published.

Hypersub takes a 5% fee on all payments. Learn more about [Pricing](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/pricing).

### Rewards

Share revenue and offer upside with your members. To enable rewards, enter a percentage of revenue to share with the rewards pool. To opt out of rewards set the percentage to zero. Learn more about [Rewards](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/rewards).

## Referrals

Reward members who share your Hypersub with referral links. Members who share links that successfully convert earn a percentage of the purchase revenue.

Your referral link is shown to a member each time they join or renew. Learn more about [Referrals](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/referrals).

## Preview

Take a first look at your Hypersub before publishing. Click the Preview button to open up your preview in a new tab. Close the tab to keep editing, or publish your membership.

## Publish

Finish creating your Hypersub by clicking the Publish button. Sign the transaction with your wallet, which may take a few seconds. Once published, your Hypersub is live and ready to join.

### Edit

Most settings on your Hypersub can be updated at any time. Click the Dashboard button to edit your membership profile or tiers, and to access other Hypersub features such as grants, refunds and settings.
