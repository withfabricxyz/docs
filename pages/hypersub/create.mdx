As creator on Hypersub your first step is creating a membership. This requires artwork, a membership name, description, and pricing. Most decisions made now can be changed later.

To get started, make sure your wallet is connected and click Create. This takes you to the [create page](https://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/create).

### Artwork

Your Hypersub artwork is the imagery displayed on your membership page, in member's wallets, on social platforms, and in marketplaces where tokens are bought and sold. This image defines your membership and is likely the first thing people see related to your Hypersub.

Hypersub supports .png and .jpg. We recommend aspect ratios 1:1 (square), 3:2 (landscape), and 2:3 (portrait) that are a minimum of 800px wide.  Learn more about [images](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/tips#images).

### Title & Description

Your membership name is the title of your Hypersub, and, similar to artwork, will be reflected in your member's wallets and elsewhere. Your description is additional information displayed on your Hypersub detailing who you are, what your Hypersub is about, and what benefits members can expect.

Descriptions can be styled in the text editor. Highlight text and click the buttons in the editor to format to your liking. You can also add important links here as well as images, gifs and video.

### Pricing

Card prices are in USD, while crypto prices are in Base ETH or any other [ERC20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) token on [Base](https://www.base.org/). This price is how much members pay per week, month or year. Most Hypersubs are priced per month.

Crypto payments settle in whichever denomination you chose for your membership, no matter which token members pay with.

Hypersub takes a 5% fee on all payments. Learn more about [pricing](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/pricing).

### Rewards

Rewards gives you the ability to share revenue with your members. For creating a membership you'll start simple, though Rewards have more advanced options.

Offer rewards by entering a percentage of revenue to share with the rewards pool. To opt out of rewards set the percentage to zero. Learn more about [Rewards](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/rewards).

### Preview

Save your draft and preview your Hypersub by clicking the Preview button. Get back to your draft any time by visiting your [dashboard > all](https://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/dashboard?from=spark).

The preview also reveals your Hypersub's theme. Your theme is based on image color, which can be changed later.

### Deploy

Finish creating your Hypersub by clicking the Deploy button. Sign the transaction with your wallet, which may take a few seconds. Once deployed, your Hypersub is ready to accept memberships.

### Edit

Most settings on your Hypersub can be updated at any time. Visit your membership page and click the Edit button. Manage your membership settings here.

You may notice other advanced settings here, which are detailed in [membership settings](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/settings).
