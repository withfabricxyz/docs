</div>

Airdrop exclusively to your members without your work going up for sale.

### Create a Claim Page

To get started go to [manifold.xyz](https://www.manifold.xyz/) and log in.

1. Click the Create button and select Claim page
2. Click New Contract and enter details matching your Hypersub or tier, and click Next
3. Upload your media, enter the details, click Save then Next
4. Enter the details of your mint page, click Next
5. Enter your mint rules. Important: set the Total Supply to Limited: 1. Click Next
6. Do not edit your Audience settings, click Next
7. Review, click Publish and confirm the transaction - this may take a few seconds
8. üéâ

Setting the supply limit to 1 does not effect how many members can receive your airdrop. It limits exposure to your mint page being discovered in the window before you airdrop. Once airdropped, your work will be sold out and not mintable by the public.

### Create a CSV

Create a members only account list for your airdrop.

1. Go to your Hypersub dashboard and click Export
2. Scroll to the account area and click the copy icon
3. Open TextEdit or similar application, create a new file, and paste your member accounts
4. Append each account with ,1 and save

Important: be sure to end your file name with .csv before you save.

### Airdrop to Members

Deliver your work directly to members.

1. Go to your Creations in Manifold and click the work you want to airdrop
2. Click the More Options tab and upload your CSV
3. Click Begin Airdrop and confirm the transaction

### Drop on Hypersub

Notify members about your airdrop, and present your work to the world.

1. Go to the Claim page on Manifold you airdropped from and copy the url
2. Go to your membership page on Hypersub and click the Drops tab
3. Click Create drop and paste in your Claim page url
4. Click Create to save and notify your members

Important: the airdrop has already occurred from Manifold, dropping on Hypersub does not airdrop again.

## Archive Membership

Reasons to archive can include:

- An event has passed
- A membership has ended
- Commitments can no longer be filled
- Mistakes were made at the contract level

To archive your membership use a combination of hidden and paused settings:

1. Go to your membership page and click the Edit button
2. Scroll to Hidden and Paused and switch them on
3. Confirm and sign the transaction

Important: be sure to fulfill any commitments to active members when archiving. Refund them if you can't.

Revive your membership any time by switching Hidden and Paused off.

## Custom Tokens

</div>

Denominate pricing in any ERC20 token on Base while creating your Hypersub.

1. Go to [BaseScan](https://basescan.org/) and search for a token (e.g. [DEGEN](https://basescan.org/token/0x4ed4e862860bed51a9570b96d89af5e1b0efefed))
2. On the token page find the Other Info section.
3. Click the copy icon to copy the contract address.
4. Go to the Create page Click the Custom option in the denomination menu
5. Paste in the address, selecting the token as your denomination

Important: custom tokens are only specified when you create your Hypersub and can not be changed later.

## Description Guidelines

Good descriptions can be key to getting members - people want to know who you are, and what your membership is about. Little or cryptic details will leave members unsure about your offerings.

- Present value quickly and clearly. Members want to know exactly what they get without effort.
- Use bullet points for easy scanning. Large blocks of text will probably not be read.
- Add links. Members want to see you're alive elsewhere and know more about you.
- Provide social proof. Show how your current members are benefiting.

## Discount Tier

Discounts are currently not available on Hypersub. In place of discounts a combination of a supply capped tier and grants can be used instead.

### Create Tier

1. Go to your dashboard and click the tiers tab
2. Click the Create tier button and enter the details, including your discounted price
4. Scroll to Supply cap, switch it on, and enter the number of members you want to discount
5. Confirm and sign to finish the tier

### Grant Time

1. Go to your dashboard and click the grants tab, then click the Create grant button
2. Select your new discount tier and paste members equal in number to its set supply cap
3. Paste 0.001 as the granted time value
3. Confirm and sign the transaction

Granting 0.001 billing period delivers your membership token to the chosen members, and fills up the supply cap. It is up to them to purchase more time.

## Hypermod

<br></br>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r1SK_LxMiUE?rel=0&enablejsapi=1" title="Enable Hypermod" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Use Hypersub to automatically add and remove members from your Farcaster channel.

### Policy

- One Hypersub, one channel
- Hypermod works with free, pay-what-you-want, or priced memberships
- Active members from all tiers will be invited to your channel.
- Important: members must be following your channel to be invited.
- Lapsed members have a 1hr grace period before removal
- Invited channel members without a Hypersub membership will not be removed
- Invited channel members who decide to join later will be removed if they lapse

Example: once the owner of the /memes Hypersub has linked the membership to the /memes channel, no other Hypersub can be linked to it.

### Verify Address

Important: your Hypersub [owner address](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/dashboard_settings#owner-address) must be added to your Farcaster account as a verified address to link with Hypermod.

1. Log in to your Warpcast account and go to [settings](https://warpcast.com/~/settings)
2. Click the Verify Addresses tab, then click the Verify an address button
3. Be sure your Hypersub owner address and the address on this page match
4. Click the Sign message button and sign the transaction to verify

### Link Channel

1. Go to your Dashboard and click the Settings tab
2. From the Hypermod section click Enable
3. Enter your channel name and click Verify
4. Go to your Farcaster channel and click the pencil icon button
5. Click Configure moderation, search for hyperbot, and select it as a moderator
6. Go back to Hypersub and celebrate üçæ

Hypermod may take a few moments to link with your channel. Link a different channel by clicking Disable to start over.

## Images

Images are essential to your Hypersub, for better results follow these guidelines when uploading:

- Use .png for most digital artwork
- Use .jpeg for photos or artwork with a lot of color
- Files should be a maximum of 10mb in size
- Files should be a minumum of 800px wide
- Supported aspect ratios are 1:1 (square), 3:2 (landscape), and 2:3 (portrait)

Hypersub employs some compression when you upload - using a larger file size to compensate will only make your page slower to load.

## Split Contract

Distribute your Hypersub revenue between multiple accounts with a split contract.

### Create Split

## Time-capped Subscriptions

<br></br>
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IjjIhHCn07g?rel=0&enablejsapi=1" title="Create an Advanced Tier" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Hypersubs can be used for limited or one time courses, events, and commitment clubs. To set up a time-capped membership use a combination of advanced settings:

- Supply cap: Do you want to limit participants?
- Start date: When does your membership begin?
- End date: When does your membership end?
- Max mintable time: Ensures members can't pay more than they need to.

12 month book club example:
- Price set to $10 per month: The minimum someone can spend is $10.
- Max mintable time set to 12 months: The maximum someone can spend is $120.
- Supply cap set to 50: The maximum amount of participants is 50.
- End date set one year out: Membership will end after 12 months.

## Verify Balance
