Verify the amount of time a subscriber has left on your Hypersub.

1. Copy the address you want to verify
2. Go to your subscription page and click Details
3. Click NFT subscription contract to open BaseScan
4. Click the Contract tab, then click the Read Contract as Proxy tab
5. Expand the balanceOf section, and paste in the address
6. Click the Query button, copy the numSeconds value
7. Open a new tab, paste the value, and append with 'seconds to months' (or weeks, quarters, years)

### Description

Descriptions can be key to getting subscribers - people want to know what your subscription is about. Little or cryptic details will leave subscribers unsure about your offerings.

- Present value quickly and clearly. Subscribers want to know exactly what they get without effort.
- Use bullet points for easy scanning. Large blocks of text will probably not be read.
- Add links. Subscribers want to see you're alive elsewhere and know more about you.
- Provide social proof. Show how your current subscribers are benefiting.

### Time-capped Subscriptions

Hypersubs can be used for limited or one time courses, events, and commitment clubs. To set up a time-capped subscription use a combination of advanced settings:

- Supply cap: Do you want to limit participants?
- Start date: When does your subscription begin?
- End date: When does your subscription end?
- Max mintable time: Ensures subscribers can't pay more than they need to.

12 month book club example:
- Price set to $10 per month: The minimum someone can spend is $10.
- Max mintable time set to 12 months: The maximum someone can spend is $120.
- Supply cap set to 50: The maximum amount of participants is 50.
- End date set one year out: Subscription will end after 12 months.
