## Create Account

To subscribe on Hypersub, you must have a wallet. Make sure it is connected and visit any membership page. Click the Subscribe button to mint time onchain.

You'll be asked for an email, which is necessary for membership notifications and is required to subscribe. Verify by entering the six-digit code sent to your email.

## With Card

</div>

Visit a card enabled membership page and click the Subscribe button. Enter your card details into the form - these will be saved for future use. Review and confirm.

As soon as the transaction completes you'll receive a membership token, with a positive balance of time. This is what grants you access to the perks and benefits promised by the creator.

When time runs out your card will be charged, refilling your token and renewing your membership. Card memberships are not eligible for [member rewards](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/rewards), but can still receive referral rewards.

### Change Card

Your card details can be updated any time. Go to your [settings](https://www.hypersub.xyz/settings) and click the Edit button in the Payments section. Enter your new card details and save.

### Cancel

Cancel your membership at any time. Go to settings and scroll to your memberships. Click the more icon and select Cancel. Confirm.

Your membership will be cancelled immediately, refunding a prorated amount. All remaining time purchased with card is burned, which may cause you to lose access to member benefits.

## With Crypto

</div>

Visit any membership page and click the Subscribe button. Click the Crypto tab and select how much time you want to purchase, then click the Subscribe button. You'll be prompted to sign the transaction with your wallet, which may take a few seconds.

As soon as the transaction completes you'll receive a membership token. With crypto, members can purchase as much time as they wish, or that the creator permits.

### Add Time

You'll be notified when your membership time is running low. To add more time, visit the membership page and click the Add Time button.

If time runs out, you still own your membership token, though you will become inactive. Inactive members no longer gain membership benefits like access, drops or other perks. Become active again by adding more time.

### Alternative Payments

Hypersub memberships now accept hundreds of tokens across multiple chains. Pay with what you have without the need to swap, bridge, or hold specific tokens.

Visit any membership page and click the Subscribe button. Click the token symbol button (e.g. ETH) near the Total to open the menu. This menu is populated based on what is in your wallet. Swap payment methods by selecting another token and subscribe.

## Referral Rewards

Another way to benefit from a membership is through referrals. Copy the link that's displayed after you subscribe, and share it with your friends. You'll get paid when they subscribe. How much you earn is determined by what percentage the creator has chosen to share.

For example, if the creator chose a 10% referral reward, and you refer someone who mints $100 worth of time, you'll earn $10. You don't have to be a member of a Hypersub to receive referral rewards.

## Membership Token

This token represents your membership and can be used to access a wide variety [token-gated](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-token-gating-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-doing-it) benefits across an ecosystem of tools and platforms. This all depends on what is offered or supported by the creator. A common example is access to subscriber only communities such as channels or group-chats.

You can think of your token as a metro card: when you subscribe, you add time to your balance. When time runs out, your balance can be refilled.
