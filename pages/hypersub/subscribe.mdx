</div>

Visit selected subscription pages and click the Subscribe button. Enter your card details into the form - these will be saved for future use. Review and confirm.

As soon as the transaction completes you'll receive a subscription token, with a positive balance of time. This is what grants you access to the perks and benefits promised by the creator.

When time runs out your card will be charged, refilling your token and renewing your subscription. Card subscriptions are not eligible for [subscriber rewards](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/rewards), but can still receive referral rewards.

### Change Card

Your card details can be updated any time. Go to your [settings](https://www.hypersub.xyz/settings) and click the Edit button in the Payments section. Enter your new card details and save.

### Cancel

Cancel your subscription at any time. Go to settings and scroll to your subscriptions. Click the more icon and select Cancel. Confirm.

Your subscription will be cancelled immediately, refunding a prorated amount. All remaining time purchased with card is burned, which may cause you to lose access to subscriber benefits.

## With Crypto

</div>

Visit any subscription page and click the Subscribe button. Click the Crypto tab and select how much time you want to purchase, then click the Subscribe button. You'll be prompted to sign the transaction with your wallet, which may take a few seconds.

As soon as the transaction completes you'll receive a subscription token. With crypto, subscribers can purchase as much time as they wish, or that the creator permits.

### Add Time

You'll be notified when your subscription time is running low. To add more time, visit the subscription page and click the Add Time button.

If time runs out, you still own your subscription token, though you will become inactive. Inactive subscribers no longer gain subscription benefits like drops, perks, or access. Become active again by adding more time.

Hypersub subscriptions now accept hundreds of tokens across multiple chains. Pay with what you have without the need to swap, bridge, or hold specific tokens.

Visit any subscription page and click the Subscribe button. Click the token symbol button (e.g. ETH) near the Total to open the menu. This menu is populated based on what is in your wallet. Swap payment methods by selecting another token and subscribe.

## Referral Rewards

Another way to benefit from a subscription is through referrals. Copy the link that's displayed after you subscribe, and share it with your friends. You'll get paid when they subscribe. How much you earn is determined by what percentage the creator has chosen to share.

For example, if the creator chose a 10% referral reward, and you refer someone who mints $100 worth of time, you'll earn $10. You don't have to be subscribed to a Hypersub to receive referral rewards.

## Subscription Token

This token represents your subscription and can be used to access a wide variety [token-gated](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-token-gating-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-doing-it) benefits across an ecosystem of tools and platforms. This all depends on what is offered or supported by the creator. A common example is access to subscriber only communities such as channels or group-chats.

You can think of your token as a metro card: when you subscribe, you add time to your balance. When time runs out, your balance can be refilled.
