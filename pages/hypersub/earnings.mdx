Get paid by withdrawing available funds from your membership.

1. Click the Withdraw button and review. **Important:** make sure the recipient account is correct as this is where all funds are sent.
2. Confirm and sign the transaction. It may take a few seconds to receive your funds.

If an alternative revenue recipient is set you will see a Transfer button. Transfer works the same as withdraw, except funds are sent to another account, address, or contract instead. Learn more about revenue recipients in [Dashboard Settings.](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/dashboard_settings)

If [card payments](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/cards) are set up, you get paid in fiat separately through your Stipe dashboard.
