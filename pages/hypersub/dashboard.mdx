# Dashboard

The Hypersub Dashboard is central to understanding and taking actions for your subscribers and income. Gain an overview of your subscription, manage subscribers, and withdraw funds from all in one place.

### Stats

Subscription stats takes a look at the overall health of your subscription at a glance. View subscriber count, monthly recurring revenue, churn, retention, lapse, and renewal rates. Use the filter above the stats line to switch date ranges. Hide stats by using the eye icon button.

### Withdraw

Get paid from your subscription by withdrawing available funds. Use the withdraw button to open the dialog and review. Important: make sure the recipient address is correct as that is where the available funds will be sent. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction. It may take a few seconds to receive your funds.

If an alternative revenue recipient is set you will see a transfer button. Transfer works the same as withdraw, except funds are sent to another specified address instead. Learn more about revenue recipients in [dashboard settings.](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/dashboard_settings.)

### Import

Import your audience from other platforms or subscriptions. Use the import button to open the grant dialog and enter your addresses. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction. Your subscription is now populated with your audience. Learn more about [grants.](https://docs.withfabric.xyz/hypersub/grants)

### Export

Export a list of your subscribers for external use. Use the export button to open the dialog. Select status and enter time purchased to filter subscribers. Use the download button to save a CSV to your device.

The export dialog can also be used for subscriber raffles. Export random addresses by switching it on and entering the number of addresses pulled. Winners are shown in the preview below.

### Subscriber Table

Take closer look at your Hypersub audience from the subscriber table. View individual subscriber infomation in each row, with important details like address and email. Use the button at the top right of the table to filter subscribers based on status such as active or churned.

### Kick

Remove subscribers by kicking them from your Hypersub. To kick a subscriber use the more icon to the right of a subcriber's row in the table. Select kick from the menu to open the kick dialog. Select a refund option if the subscriber has a remaining balance. Confirm to open your wallet and sign the transaction.

Kick can be useful for removing inactive subscribers to create openings in a supply cap, or for removing individials due to misconduct within community guidelines.
