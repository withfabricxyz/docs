# Deploying a CrowdFi Contract

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import { Callout } from 'nextra-theme-docs'
import { Address } from 'components/Address'

CrowdFi contracts are deployed by invoking the `deployCampaign` function on
the factory contract for a given network. The function uses OpenZeppelin Clones to create a proxy and initialize
the contract with campaign parameters.

#### Campaign Parameters

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`recipient`|`address`|the address of the recipient, where funds are sent on success|
|`minGoal`|`uint256`|the minimum funding amount acceptable for successful financing|
|`maxGoal`|`uint256`|the maximum funding amount accepted for the financing round|
|`minContribution`|`uint256`|the minimum deposit an account can make in one deposit|
|`maxContribution`|`uint256`|the maximum deposit an account can make in one or more deposits|
|`holdOff`|`uint32`|the number of seconds to wait until the campaign starts|
|`duration`|`uint32`|the runtime of the campaign, in seconds|
|`erc20TokenAddr`|`address`|the address of the ERC-20 token used for payments, or 0 address for native token|


#### Native Token vs ERC-20

CrowdFi contracts support native tokens as well as ERC-20 compliant tokens. The contribute and yield functions are different depending
on whether the contract is native token or ERC-20 denominated.

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  CrowdFi contracts do not support rebasing tokens! Do not use them as the denominated token.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  CrowdFi contracts support fee taking tokens. The number of CrowdFi tokens minted on contribution will factor in the fee.
</Callout>


#### Factory Addresses

|Network|Address|
|-----|-------|
|`Ethereum Mainnet`|<Address chain="mainnet" name="factory" />|
|`Ethereum Sepolia`|<Address chain="sepolia" name="factory" />|
|`Polygon`|<Address chain="polygon" name="factory" />|
|`Arbitrum`|<Address chain="arbitrum" name="factory" />|
|`Optimism`|<Address chain="optimism" name="factory" />|
|`Zora`|<Address chain="zora" name="factory" />|

#### Example Deployment

<Tabs items={['ethers', 'foundry']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { Contract, Signer } from 'ethers';
  const abi = require('path/to/CrowdFinancingV1Factory.abi.json');
  const contract = new Contract(factoryContractAddress, abi, signer);

  // Native token (ETH)
  const erc20TokenAddress = '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000';

  const tx = await contract.deployCampaign(
    recipientAddress,
    minGoal,
    maxGoal,
    minContribution,
    maxContribution,
    holdOffSeconds,
    durationSeconds,
    erc20TokenAddress,
  );

  console.log('deploy tx', tx);
  ```
