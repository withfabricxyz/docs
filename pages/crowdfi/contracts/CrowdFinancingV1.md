Each instance of a CrowdFinancing Contract represents a single campaign with a goal
of raising funds for a specific purpose. The contract is deployed by the creator through
the CrowdFinancingV1Factory contract. The creator specifies the recipient address, the
token to use for payments, the minimum and maximum funding goals, the minimum and maximum
contribution amounts, and the start and end times.
The campaign is deemed successful if the minimum funding goal is met by the end time, or the
maximum funding goal is met before the end time.
If the campaign is successful funds can be transferred to the recipient address. If the
campaign is not successful the funds can be withdrawn by the contributors.
