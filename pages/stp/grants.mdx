# Grants

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can create grants.
</Callout>

Creators can grant access to accounts for a given amount of time. This can be done for a single account, or for a group of accounts with a single transaction.
Granted time is measured in seconds and is tracked separately from purchased time. The expiration date of a subscription is the sum of remaining purchased time and remaining grant time.

Granting will mint a new NFT if the beneficiary doesn't currently have a subscription. If they do, the time extends their subscription.
