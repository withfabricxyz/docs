# Reading Collection State

There are many view functions for collection and subscribers. The SDK leverages multicall to make several calls in a single request. See the [contract reference](/stp/contracts/STPV1#functions)
section for details about each view function.

## Collection State

The collection state object contains all relevent contract level state.

  ```ts
  import {
    fetchCollectionState,
    CollectionState,
  } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const state: CollectionState = await fetchCollectionState({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
  });

  // Typedef for reference
  type CollectionState = {
    /** The address of the NFT */
    address: `0x${string}`;
    /** Can accounts contribute */
    isPaused: boolean;
    /** The name of the NFT */
    name: string;
    /** The symbol of the NFT */
    symbol: string;
    /** The contract metadata URI */
    contractURI: string;
    /** The token metadata URI */
    tokenUri: string;
    /** The number of tokens (wei) which buys one second of time */
    tokensPerSecond: bigint;
    /** Minimum purchase in seconds */
    minimumPurchaseSeconds: bigint;
    /** Owner address */
    ownerAddress: `0x${string}`;
    /** The address of the ERC-20 token used for the campaign */
    erc20Address: `0x${string}`;
    /** The fee in basis points to charge for transfers */
    feeBips: number;
    /** The address of the fee collector */
    feeCollectorAddress: `0x${string}`;
    /** The balance of the creator */
    creatorBalance: bigint;
    /** The supply cap */
    supplyCap: bigint;
    /** The number of tokens minted */
    totalSupply: bigint;
    /** The transfer recipient */
    transferRecipient: `0x${string}`;
    /** The total reward points */
    totalRewardPoints: bigint;
    /** The reward basis points */
    rewardBps: number;
    /** The reward multiplier */
    rewardMultiplier: bigint;
  };
  ```

## Subscriber State

Subscriber state contains all relevent state for a given account.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import {
    fetchSubscriberState,
    SubscriberState,
  } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const state: SubscriberState = await fetchSubscriberState({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    account: '0x...',
  });

  // Typedef for reference
  type SubscriberState = {
    /** The address of the account */
    address: `0x${string}`;
    /** The token id (0 means no subscription) */
    tokenId: bigint;
    /** The amount of seconds the account can refund */
    refundableSeconds: bigint;
    /** The amount of seconds the account has purchased */
    secondsPurchased: bigint;
    /** The amount of tokens the account can withdraw from rewards */
    rewardBalance: bigint;
    /** The amount of reward points the account has */
    rewardPoints: bigint;
    /** Expires at */
    expiresAt: Date;
  };
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Combined State (Context)

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import {
    fetchContext,
    FullState,
  } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const state: SubscriberState = await fetchContext({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    account: '0x...',
  });

  // Typedef for reference
  type FullState = {
    /** The state of the campaign */
    collection: CollectionState;
    /** The state of the connected account */
    subscriber: SubscriberState;
    /** The holdings of the connected account */
    holdings: ApprovedTokens;
  };
  ```
