# Subscription Token Protocol

STP makes generating recurring revenue onchain as simple as creating an NFT.

### How it Works

1. A creator or business specifies a period of time (eg 1 month) and a price per period (eg 10 USDC) then deploys their NFT subscription contract onchain.
2. Users mint the NFT by purchasing the desired amount of time (eg 6 months for 60 USDC). Doing so grants them access to whatever apps, content, and experiences have been gated on the subscription NFT.
3. Access will remain until the user's balance of time (eg 6 months) equals zero, at which point, access will be denied unless they mint additional time.

Pre-paid transit cards are a good analogy for NFT subscriptions. So long as the card has a positive balance of time, it's both valuable and useful. However, once the balance of the card reaches zero, though you still own it, it's neither valuable nor useful. Same with an NFT subscription.

### Onchain Subscriber Rewards

Onchain subscriber rewards are an optional incentive that can be enabled by the owner of the NFT contract, simply by specifying a percentage of the monthly recurring revenue they're willing to share.

The percentage they specify is allocated into an onchain reward pool immediately after a subscription has been minted.

The more users that subscribe, the bigger the pool. The earlier and longer a user subscribes for, the larger their share of the reward pool.

Users must have an active subscription in order to withdraw their rewards. If their subscription lapses and they do not resubscribe, their rewards can be slashed.

Subscriber rewards can encourage early-adoption, long-term subscriptions, and retention.

### Onchain Referral Rewards

Owners of the NFT contract can create onchain referral rewards by specifying a percentage of subscription purchases they’re willing to share.

For example:

1. Alice specifies a 10% referral reward for her NFT subscription
2. Bob generates a unique referral URL for Alice’s subscription and shares it with others
3. Charlie purchases a 100 USDC subscription to Alice using Bob’s link
4. Alice receives 90 USDC
5. Bob receives 10 USDC

Referral payments are onchain and made at the time of mint (no withdraw required).

This can incentivize organic growth and distribution.

### Fees

The protocol takes a 4% fee on all subscriptions.

### Onchain Partner Rewards
Any entity that facilitates the deployment of NFT subscription contracts is eligible to receive 50% of the protocol fee.

eg. if Alice uses app.xyz to deploy her NFT subscription and it generates 100,000 USDC in annual recurring revenue then the protocol will receive 2,000 USDC and app.xyz will receive 2,000 USDC.

Protocol revenue sharing is all onchain and in perpetuity.

### Interoperability

STP contains a `mintFor` function. Put simply, this means any account can purchase a subscription on behalf of any other account. This enables contract interactions and credit card payments.

For example: Alice subscribes for 10 USDC per month on app.xyz. She gives her credit card info to app.xyz, who then charges her card 10 USD each month, and in turn, mints 10 USDC worth of time on her behalf.

With smart contract wallets, MPC wallets, EIP-4337, and other novel forms of abstraction, it's possible for Alice to subscribe without ever knowing she's using crypto.

### Additional Features

#### Grants
The owner of the NFT contract can issue onchain grants simply by specifying an address and amount of time they wish to grant. [Learn More](/stp/grants)

### Refunds
The owner of the NFT contract can issue onchain refunds simply by specifying an address and amount of time they wish to refund.  [Learn More](/stp/refunds)

### Max Supply
The owner of the NFT contract can specify an onchain supply cap, thus limiting the number of subscriptions available to mint.  [Learn More](/stp/advanced#adjusting-supply-cap)

### Pause
The owner of the NFT contract can pause subscriptions any time. [Learn More](/stp/advanced#pausing-and-unpausing)

### Ownership Transfer
The owner of the NFT contract can transfer ownership to any valid address. [Learn More](/stp/advanced#transfering-ownership)

### Revenue Recipient
The owner of the NFT contract can specify any valid address as the onchain subscription revenue recipient, for example a splits contract, vault, multisig safe, or DAO.
