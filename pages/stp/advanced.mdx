# Advanced Protocol Usage

Advanced functions are available for managing the contract. These functions are not required for normal operation.


## Pausing and Unpausing

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can pause and unpause minting.
</Callout>

The contract can be paused and unpaused using [Pausable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#Pausable).
Pausing the contract only prevents mints and renewals. All other functions remain callable.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { preparePause, prepareUnpause } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  // Pause the contract
  const pause = await preparePause({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
  });

  const pauseReceipt = await pause();

  // Unpause the contract
  const unpause = await prepareUnpause({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
  });

  const unpauseReceipt = await unpause();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Adjusting Supply Cap

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can adjust the supply cap.
</Callout>

The maxmimum number of subscribers can be adjusted using the `setSupplyCap` function. The supply cap can be set to any value greater or equal to the current supply. Additionally, the
supply cap can be set to 0 to allow unlimited subscribers (default).

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareSetSupplyCap } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const setCap = await prepareSetSupplyCap({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    supplyCap: 1000n,
  });

  const receipt = await setCap();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Transfering Ownership

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can transfer ownership.
</Callout>

Transfers are two step, using [Ownable2Step](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable2Step). Transfers are started via the `transferOwnership` function.
**This can be used to stage a backup owner**, or to transfer ownership to a new owner.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareTransferOwnership } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const transfer = await prepareTransferOwnership({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    newOwner: '0x...',
  });

  const receipt = await transfer();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Accepting Ownership

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the PENDING contract owner can accept ownership
</Callout>

Once a transfer is started, the pending owner must call `acceptOwnership` to complete the transfer.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareAcceptOwnership } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const accept = await prepareAcceptOwnership({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
  });

  const receipt = await accept();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## ERC-20 Reconciliation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can reconcile the ERC20 balance.
</Callout>

For ERC20 denominated contracts, it's possible that an account accidentally transfers tokens to the contract by interacting directly with the ERC20 contract.
If that happens, the `reconcileERC20Balance` function can be called to reconcile the balance of the contract with the ERC20 contract, making the funds available for withdrawal.

These funds could be used to pay for a subscription using the `mintFor` function.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareReconcileERC20Balance } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const reconcile = await prepareReconcileERC20Balance({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
  });

  const receipt = await reconcile();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## ERC-20 Recovery

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Not supported for the contract's denominated ERC20 token. Use `reconcileERC20Balance` instead.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can recover ERC20 tokens.
</Callout>

If any ERC20 tokens are transferred to the contract unintentionally, they can be recovered using the `recoverERC20` function.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareRecoverERC20 } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const recover = await prepareRecoverERC20({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    erc20Address: '0x...',
    recipient: '0x...',
    amount: 31337n,
  });

  const receipt = await recover();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Native Token Reconciliation

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Only supported for contracts denominated with native tokens. For ERC-20 denominated contracts use `recoverNativeTokens` instead.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can recover native tokens.
</Callout>

If native tokens are transferred to the contract unintentionally (via selfdestruct, etc), they can be reconciled using the `reconcileNativeBalance` function.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareReconcileNativeBalance } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const recover = await prepareReconcileNativeBalance({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
  });

  const receipt = await recover();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Native Token Recovery

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Not supported for contract denominated with native tokens. Use `reconcileNativeBalance` instead.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can recover native tokens.
</Callout>

If native tokens are transferred to the contract unintentionally (via selfdestruct, etc), they can be recovered using the `recoverNativeTokens` function.

<Tabs items={['sdk']}>
  <Tab>
  ```ts
  import { prepareRecoverNativeTokens } from '@withfabricxyz/protocol-sdks/stpv1';

  const recover = await prepareRecoverNativeTokens({
    contractAddress: '0x...',
    recipient: '0x...',
  });

  const receipt = await recover();
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Renouncing Ownership

<Callout type="error" emoji="🚫">
  This is a dangerous call. Once ownership is renounced, it cannot be recovered.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Only the contract owner can renounce ownership.
</Callout>

The owner can renounce ownership of the contract using [Ownable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable-renounceOwnership).
This will transfer funds, pause minting, and prevent all ownable functions from being called. This is intended to be used for shutting down a subscription.
