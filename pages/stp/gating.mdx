# Token Gating

Given that subscriptions are onchain, the subscription contract is used to limit access. This is done by checking the `balanceOf` of a user's wallet address on the subscription contract.
If `balanceOf` exceeds 0, the user has a valid subscription and should be granted access to the gated content. Otherwise, they can be directed to mint or renew a subscription, which can be done via Hypersub or by using the SDK.

The power of token gating is that paid access credentials move with users to multiple applications, giving the creator more freedom to build and monetize their community.

### Add Token Gating to Your Application

To add token gating to your application, you will need to:
* Add the ability for a user to connect their wallet and sign a message
* Add functionality to check the `balanceOf` of a user's wallet address on the subscription contract

With those two pieces in place, any app can become a SaaS provider with STP.
