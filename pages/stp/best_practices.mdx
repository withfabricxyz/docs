# Best Practices

The following suggestions are best practices for deploying and managing a subscription contract.

#### Set Pending Owner

Setting the pending owner to a backup account or multi-sig can allow recovery of the contract in the event that the owner key is lost. This is a common practice for contracts that hold funds.

#### Set the Transfer recipient

Setting the transfer recipient to the owner account, or another owned account, allows permissionless and automated transfers.

#### Leverage Referrals

Referrers earn a percentage of the subscription fee for each subscriber they refer. This can be a great way to leverage your audience to bootstrap your subscription. You can add/remove referral codes at any time.

#### Enable Rewards

Rewards are a great way to incentivize your subscribers to stay subscribed. You can set a reward when deploying. Rewards are redeemable for the denominated token after each withdraw.

#### Give Trial Subscriptions

Leverage grants to give trial subscriptions to your fans/customers.
